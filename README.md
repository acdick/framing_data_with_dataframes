A functional organizational structure separates employees with specific skills into departments such as Human Resources, Sales, Marketing, Finance and Engineering, etc. This can produce a silo effect, in which useful information is created, but not necessarily shared. In response, companies assemble cross-functional teams to facilitate sharing and learning across the organization.

These teams can increase overall company effectiveness because they strengthen the firm’s interdependent internal network. For example, strategic decisions can be improved by incorporating, say, information and insights inferred by data scientists.
